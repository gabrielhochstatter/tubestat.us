# tubestat.us

curl your commmute!

### What is this?

An ultra simple node.js based web app to check the status of the tube in London.

### How do I use it?

Right now you just `curl tubestat.us` and you should get a list of lines and their statuses!

Eventuall I might add more stuff like a more verbose output of actual disruptions, and a front-end that's actually human-readable from a browser (don't try it now unless you love gibberish ðŸ™ˆ)
