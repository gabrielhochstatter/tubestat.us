# tubestat.us

curl your commmute!

### What is this?

An ultra simple node.js based web app to check the status of the tube in London.

### How do I use it?

Right now you just `curl tubestatus1.herokuapp.com` and you should get a list of lines and their statuses!

I also own the domain tubestat.us I'm just too lazy to hook it up right now 🐒
